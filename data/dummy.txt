Prior research emphasizes the paradoxical nature of coopetition and the need for specialized
capabilities—coopetition capability—to deal effectively with opportunities and challenges stemming from the simultaneous pursuit of cooperation and competition and to create superior value.
However, we know little about the underlying conceptual properties of coopetition capability
(construct clarity) and lack a reliable and valid scale to measure it (construct validity). We
conduct a study in three phases to address this critical gap. First, building on paradox literature,
we conceptualize coopetition capability as a multidimensional construct reflected by three underlying dimensions: coopetition mindset, analytical acumen, and executional skills. Second, we
develop a 15-item psychometrically valid scale using a sample of 647 coopetitive alliances in
high-technology sectors. Finally, using a matched sample of 536 coopetitive alliances, we
extend the focal construct’s nomological network by examining two relationships: coopetition
experience’s impact on coopetition capability and the effect of coopetition capability on the relationship between the coopetition paradox and value creation. Overall, our paper lays a foundation for deeper theory development and empirical research on coopetition by providing muchneeded construct clarity and psychometrically valid measures for coopetition capability.

Firms often engage in relationships that involve simultaneous cooperation and competition
with an intent to create value (Gnyawali & Ryan Charleton, 2018; Ketchen, Snow, & Hoover,
2004; Rai, 2016). Contrary to a traditional view in alliance research that considered competition among alliance partners harmful as it could weaken cooperation, limit resource
exchange, and increase instability and risk of alliance failure (Das & Teng, 1998, 2000;
Hamel, 1991; Kale, Singh, & Perlmutter, 2000; Khanna, Gulati, & Nohria, 1998; Park &
Ungson, 2001), more recent perspectives—horizontal alliances (e.g., Belderbos, Gilsing, &
Lokshin, 2012; Luo, Rindfleisch, & Tse, 2007; Nault & Tyagi, 2001) and coopetition
(e.g., Bengtsson & Kock, 2000; Gnyawali, He, & Madhavan, 2006; Ketchen et al., 2004)
—suggest that such behaviors are important and even necessary for managing opportunities
and challenges brought about by rapid technological changes, competitive pressures, and
demand uncertainties (Ansari, Garud, & Kumaraswamy, 2016; Burgers, Hill, & Kim,
1993; Gnyawali & Park, 2011). However, the simultaneity of the opposing logics of cooperation and competition (Chen, 2008; Gnyawali, Madhavan, He, & Bengtsson, 2016) invariably
leads to greater tensions between the alliance partners because of the need to tactfully balance
common and private benefits (Gnyawali & Ryan Charleton, 2018). Consequently, managing
these relationships effectively is inherently more challenging and demanding (Ansari et al.,
2016; Hannah & Eisenhardt, 2018; Hoffmann, Lavie, Reuer, & Shipilov, 2018).
In this respect, scholars have argued that firms need a specialized set of capabilities—coopetition capability—that would help them effectively manage opportunities and challenges
stemming from coopetition (e.g., Bengtsson, Raza-Ullah, & Vanyushyn, 2016; Gnyawali
et al., 2016; Raza-Ullah, 2020). While existing research has provided several views on the
nature of coopetition capability, we lack a strong conceptual and empirical foundation for
coopetition capability as a construct (Hoffmann et al., 2018). Accordingly, Hoffmann et al.
(2018: 3044) argue that “despite some preliminary qualitative research . . . , little is known
about firms’ approaches to managing the tension between competition and cooperation.”
Put differently, coopetition capability lacks “construct clarity,” which Suddaby (2010) suggests is critical for any systematic conceptual and empirical research. An equally important
and inseparable issue is the lack of a scale that precisely and accurately operationalizes
and measures coopetition capability, or what is commonly called “construct validity”
(Bacharach, 1989; Bagozzi, Yi, & Phillips, 1991; MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Podsakoff,
2011). Construct validity is necessary for researchers to “synthesize research and develop
normative guidelines for managers” (Boyd, Bergh, Ireland, & Ketchen, 2013: 3).
Considering these gaps, we ask the following research questions: (a) What unique features
constitute coopetition capability (construct clarity)? and (b) How is coopetition capability
operationalized and measured (construct validity)?
We address these questions by drawing on the paradox literature (e.g., Lewis, 2000; Smith
& Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005; Poole & Van de Ven, 1989). Among the various
approaches to deal with paradoxes (see Lewis, 2000; Lewis & Smith, 2014; Poole & Van de
Ven, 1989; Smith & Lewis, 2011 for more details), coopetition research emphasizes adopting
Rai et al. / Walking the Tightrope 2355
the integration approach to deal with paradoxical tensions inherent in coopetition (e.g.,
Bengtsson et al., 2016; Chen, 2008; Gnyawali et al., 2016). Such an approach entails
viewing the opposing forces of cooperation and competition as a duality—“interdependent
[as opposed to independent and separate]—both contradictory and complementary”
(Farjoun, 2010: 203)—and the interplay of these opposing forces as “interwoven and synergistic” (Andriopoulos & Lewis, 2009: 697). As a result, the integration approach offers an
opportunity to combine the paradoxical elements synergistically (Gnyawali et al., 2016;
Lado, Boyd, & Hanlon, 1997). However, it also invariably exacerbates the intensity of paradoxical tensions as the inherent contradictions gain more salience when the opposing forces
are juxtaposed (Smith & Lewis, 2011). Keeping this in mind, we conceptualize coopetition
capability as a firm-level capability that helps firms adopt the integration approach to
realize two objectives: leverage the positive potential of the cooperation–competition
paradox and manage the resulting paradoxical tensions.
We conduct our study in three phases. First, building on prior literature and drawing
insights from managers’ interviews and a focus group, we explicate the conceptual domain
of coopetition capability. We posit coopetition capability as a second-order construct reflected
by three underlying first-order organizational-level capabilities: coopetition mindset, analytical acumen, and executional skills. Second, we use primary data from 647 coopetitive alliances in high-technology sectors to develop a 15-item psychometrically valid scale for
measuring coopetition capability. In the final phase, we use a matched sample of 536 coopetitive alliances to examine coopetition capability in its broader nomological network.
Specifically, we show that coopetition experience influences coopetition capability positively
and that coopetition capability moderates the relationship between the coopetition paradox
and value creation positively.
This paper addresses a critical research gap underscored by Hoffmann et al. (2018: 3037)
that “we know little about the unique capabilities required for managing the interplay of competition and cooperation.” We make three important contributions to the literature. First, we
provide much-needed construct clarity to the coopetition capability construct by systematically conceptualizing it as a multidimensional construct with unique microlevel processes
and organizational routines. Second, we pave the way for more in-depth theorizing and
nuanced empirical research on coopetition by developing a psychometrically valid scale
that captures the most salient elements of the construct. Finally, we extend the focal construct’s existing nomological network and thereby advance a long-standing discussion
regarding the nature of coopetition and its role in value creation (Gnyawali et al., 2006;
Gnyawali & Ryan Charleton, 2018; Hoffmann et al., 2018; Ketchen et al., 2004; Rai, 2016).
Conceptual Underpinnings for Coopetition Capability
Horizontal Alliances and Coopetition Research: Key Insights and Overlaps
Research on strategic alliances has traditionally viewed cooperation and competition as
“separate modes of interaction among firms” (Hoffmann et al., 2018: 3034) and suggests
that competitive tension between alliance partners is harmful as it could weaken cooperation,
limit resource exchange/knowledge transfer, aggravate risk of opportunistic behavior, and
increase instability and susceptibility to alliance failure (Arslan, 2018; Das & Teng, 1998;
2356 Journal of Management / September 2023
2000; Hamel, 1991; Kale et al., 2000; Khanna et al., 1998; Park & Russo, 1996; Park &
Ungson, 2001). More recently, however, two overlapping but distinct streams of research
have evolved, arguing that alliance partners often cooperate and compete simultaneously to
generate mutually beneficial outcomes (Hoffmann et al., 2018): horizontal alliances, referred
to as “alliances between competitors” operating at the same level in the industry value chain
(Belderbos et al., 2012: 1813; also see, Burgers et al., 1993; Gimeno, 2004; Luo et al., 2007;
Nault & Tyagi, 2001; Oxley, Sampson, & Silverman, 2009), and coopetition, referred to as
“simultaneous competition and cooperation among firms with value creation intent”
(Gnyawali & Ryan Charleton, 2018: 2513; also see Bengtsson & Kock, 2000; Gnyawali
et al., 2006; Ketchen et al., 2004).
Both streams of research generally agree on the motivations for forming such interfirm
relationships (Belderbos et al., 2012; Gnyawali & Ryan Charleton, 2018; Lado et al.,
1997). Specifically, firms enter into such alliances for developing new technologies and products in response to the convergence of technologies, shortened product life cycles, and emergence of new technologies (Belderbos et al., 2012; Burgers et al., 1993; Gnyawali & Park,
2011), learning and gaining access to critical resources and capabilities (Burgers et al.,
1993; Gnyawali & Park, 2009), entering new markets and reducing uncertainty (Burgers
et al., 1993; Gnyawali & Park, 2009), mitigating competitive pressure due to decline or maturity of an industry (Luo, 2007), improving competitive position (Gnyawali & Park, 2009),
and/or reducing costs and sharing risks (Fernandez, Le Roy, & Chiambaretto, 2018;
Gnyawali & Park, 2011).
Similarly, despite these advantages, both research streams also agree that pursuing such
interfirm relationships is inherently more challenging (Gnyawali & Ryan Charleton, 2018;
Hamel, 1991; Hannah & Eisenhardt, 2018; Hoffmann et al., 2018). The reason is that simultaneity of the contradictory forces of cooperation and competition—cooperation facilitates
alignment of objectives while competition promotes the pursuit of private agendas
(Gnyawali & Park, 2009; Kale et al., 2000; Khanna et al., 1998)—invariably results in
greater tensions between the alliance partners (Ansari et al., 2016; Das & Teng, 2000;
Hamel, 1991; Hoffmann et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2007). Such relationships are more susceptible to failure (Park & Russo, 1996) as they face greater risks of opportunistic behavior,
including appropriation of a partner’s critical resources (Das & Teng, 1998; Lavie, 2006)
and undesirable knowledge spillovers, reduced commitment, limited resource sharing, misalignment of incentive structure, and/or free ridership (Belderbos et al., 2012; Gnyawali &
Park, 2009; Kale et al., 2000; Khanna et al., 1998).
Therefore, how firms manage the tensions that stem from the pursuit of simultaneous cooperation and competition is a matter of central concern in both streams of research (Hoffmann
et al., 2018). In this respect, prior research has identified two broad approaches to managing
the tensions in such relationships: separation or integration of contradictory elements (Poole
& Van de Ven, 1989). In the separation-based approaches, partners may pursue (a) organizational separation where alliance partners employ different organizational units or teams
to engage in cooperation and competition elements. For example, in the Apple-Samsung relationship, while the sales teams of both firms compete fiercely to capture greater smartphone
market share, the supply chain teams of both firms simultaneously collaborate to facilitate the
timely supply of components from Samsung to Apple (Brandenburger & Nalebuff, 2021).
Next, partner firms may pursue (b) domain separation, where they engage in simultaneous
Rai et al. / Walking the Tightrope 2357
competition and cooperation but these activities take place in different domains (e.g., product
lines, geographical markets, or value chain activities). For example, in 2013, Ford and GM
agreed to share the transmission technologies at the R&D stage but competed in manufacturing operations (Brandenburger & Nalebuff, 2021). Finally, there is (c) temporal separation,
where partners switch between cooperation and competition over time. For example,
Volkswagen follows a cooperative approach with a preferred supplier while designing and
developing a part but induces price competition among its global suppliers while procuring
it (Wilhelm & Sydow, 2018).
Scholars, however, argue that separation-based approaches suffer from one major limitation. Even if firms employ organizational, domain, or temporal separation for buffering competitive elements from collaborative elements of the relationship, the top management still
needs to integrate and coordinate their contradictory demands at higher levels, which
causes tension (Bengtsson et al., 2016; Eisenhardt, Furr, & Bingham, 2010; Gnyawali
et al., 2016). Therefore, scholars recommend the integration approach, which involves combining the contradictory elements of cooperation and competition as interdependent opposites
(e.g., Chen, 2008; Hoffmann et al., 2018; Smith & Lewis, 2011). Although the notion of interdependence between cooperation and competition is a key concept in horizontal alliance literature for explaining various outcomes (e.g., formation of countervailing alliances [Gimeno,
2004] or effect on firms’ value in alliances with rivals [Oxley et al., 2009]), this stream of
literature has surprisingly paid little attention to examining the integration approach for managing tensions stemming from the simultaneity of cooperation and competition. Next, we
describe how recent coopetition research is beginning to address this gap (e.g., Bengtsson
et al., 2016; Gnyawali et al., 2016).
Paradoxical Tensions in Coopetitive Alliances
Drawing from paradox literature (e.g., Lewis, 2000; Poole & Van de Ven, 1989; Smith &
Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), coopetition scholars suggest that coopetition at its
core involves a cooperation-competition paradox (Bengtsson et al., 2016; Gnyawali et al.,
2016; Raza-Ullah, 2020), where a paradox consists of “contradictory yet interrelated elements
that exist simultaneously and persist over time” (Smith & Lewis, 2011: 382). Moreover, the
central concept in any paradoxical situation is tension, which emerges because contradictory
elements “seem logical when considered in isolation, but irrational, inconsistent, and even
absurd when juxtaposed” (Smith & Lewis, 2011: 387). Thus, the key to managing these relationships is to understand and address this paradox and the resultant paradoxical tension for
realizing the potential opportunities of synergistic value creation (Arslan, 2018; Gnyawali &
Ryan Charleton, 2018; Lado et al., 1997; Park & Ungson, 2001) and for minimizing any
increased susceptibility to alliance failure and value destruction (Gnyawali & Ryan
Charleton, 2018; Hoffmann et al., 2018; Park & Russo, 1996).
In this respect, alliance partners may adopt an integration approach that involves “developing a wholly new conception” that supersedes the oppositional elements (Poole & Van de
Ven, 1989: 573) and emphasizes synergistic combination. Specifically, integration requires
that managers view seemingly opposing forces as a duality: “while [the individual elements
are] conceptually distinct [and contradictory], [they] are no longer separate but, rather, are
interdependent and potentially compatible—mutually enabling and a constituent of one
2358 Journal of Management / September 2023
another” (Farjoun, 2010: 205). Such an approach is potentially more rewarding as it enables
firms to explore interdependencies and complementarities between the contradictory elements, leveraging the “energizing potential” of a paradox (Andriopoulos & Lewis, 2009:
702). However, it also invariably accentuates the paradoxical tension because the inherent
contradictions between the opposing forces gain more salience when such forces are juxtaposed (Smith & Lewis, 2011). As a result, firms would likely find that integration is “cognitively and administratively taxing” and adopting it successfully is far from a straightforward
process (Hoffmann et al., 2018: 3043).
For these reasons, prior coopetition research argues that a set of specialized capabilities—
coopetition capability—is required to help firms adopt the integration approach effectively
(e.g., Bengtsson et al., 2016; Gnyawali et al., 2016). A question may arise at this point:
why is coopetition capability necessary when a well-established construct of alliance capability already exists? Although alliance capabilities (Schilke & Goerzen, 2010) are important in
coopetition alliances, they are not specifically purposed or equipped to help firms understand
and manage the coopetition paradox, particularly with respect to the integration approach. We
argue that coopetition capability with its underlying routines and mechanisms would fill this
critical need, thus enabling alliance partners to leverage the cooperation-competition paradox
in a way that creatively “captures both extremes” (Eisenhardt, 2000: 703) and manages the
resultant paradoxical tensions (Bengtsson et al., 2016; Gnyawali et al., 2016). A body of
work has begun to give shape to the coopetition capability construct along these lines.
However, we still lack a clear understanding of coopetition capability’s underlying conceptual properties (Hoffmann et al., 2018). Next, we provide a critical review of extant research
on coopetition capability and build on this review to systematically develop the construct.
Phase I: Conceptualizing Coopetition Capability
Coopetition Capability: A Review and Assessment of Existing Research
Gnyawali and Park (2011) first introduced the concept of coopetition capability, noting
the role of coopetition mindset, coopetition experience, and superior and complementary
resources. Building on these notions, Gnyawali et al. (2016) then conceptualized coopetition capability as paradox management capability consisting of two dimensions: analytical
capability and executional capability. Analytical capability enables firms to understand the
coopetition paradox cognitively, and executional capability helps to deal with the paradox.
Relatedly, Bengtsson et al. (2016: 22) conceptualized coopetition capability as a unidimensional construct and defined it as “the ability to think paradoxically and to initiate processes that help firms attain and maintain a moderate level of tension, irrespective of the
strength of the paradox.” In a more recent work, Bengtsson, Raza-Ullah, and Srivastava
(2020: 3) broadened the concept by arguing that coopetition capability is “a firm’s
ability to (a) understand the paradoxical nature of coopetition, (b) develop a repertoire
of alternative strategies, and (c) make timely and accurate strategic decisions to balance
the contradictory demands.” Similarly, Raza-Ullah (2020: 6) conceptualized it as a twodimensional construct: “emotional capability (i.e., the organizational ability to recognize,
accept, and embrace conflicting emotions) and balancing capability (i.e., the organizational ability to balance competing demands without jeopardizing the common
Rai et al. / Walking the Tightrope 2359
objectives).” For details on existing studies on coopetition capability, see Table A1 in the
online supplement. Table 1 provides an index of all the supplementary material available at
http://xxx.sagepub.com/supplemental.
These prior works provide useful insights in understanding coopetition capability, but existing definitions and conceptualizations are ambiguous and often contradictory, thereby undermining construct clarity. For example, while prior experience is often viewed as an antecedent of
alliance capability (Heimeriks & Duysters, 2007; Kale, Dyer, & Singh, 2002; Schilke &
Goerzen, 2010), Gnyawali and Park (2011) and Bengtsson et al. (2016) view prior coopetition
experience as part of coopetition capability. This contradicts the idea that the construct definition
should not incorporate antecedents or outcomes (Suddaby, 2010). Similarly, confusion exists
whether coopetition mindset is a distinct element (Gnyawali & Park, 2011), is a part of analytical
capability (Gnyawali et al., 2016), or is at all an element of coopetition capability (Bengtsson
et al., 2016). Furthermore, whereas Raza-Ullah (2020) conceptualized balancing capability as
a combination of analytical capability and executional capability, Gnyawali et al. (2016) considered analytical and executional capability as distinct elements. Besides, Raza-Ullah (2020) draws
from emotional ambivalence literature to conceptualize emotional capability as a specific component of coopetition capability. However, emotion could be a part of cognition per the paradox
literature (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), which is consistent with the coopetition mindset as conceptualized by other researchers (e.g., Gnyawali & Park, 2011; Bengtsson
et al., 2020). Finally, superior and complementary resources noted initially as a part of coopetition capability (Gnyawali & Park, 2011) are not really unique to coopetition or the integration
approach, as they are important even in the context of strategic alliances (Lambe, Spekman,
& Hunt, 2002; Madhok & Tallman, 1998).
As such, existing conceptualizations of coopetition capability are loose and fragmented.
The overall confusion about the definitions, nature, and dimensions of coopetition capabilit
